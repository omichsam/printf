# ALX-SWE Programme TEAM WORK [0x11. C - printf]



# Tasks
## 0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
    - Write a function that produces output according to a format.
    - Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
    - Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
    - write output to stdout, the standard output stream
    - format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
        - c
        - s
        - %
    - You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
    - You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    - You don’t have to handle field width
    - You don’t have to handle precision
    - You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
## 1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
    - Handle the following conversion specifiers:
        - d
        - i
    - You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    - You don’t have to handle field width
    - You don’t have to handle precision
    - You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
## 2. With a face like mine, I do better in print
    - Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
    - b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

## 3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
    - Handle the following conversion specifiers:
        - u
        - oup project
        - x
        - X
    - You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    - You don’t have to handle field width
    - You don’t have to handle precision
    - You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
## 4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
    - Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
## 5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
    - Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
    - S : prints the string.
    - Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
## 6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
    - Handle the following conversion specifier: p.
    - You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    - You don’t have to handle field width
    - You don’t have to handle precision
    - You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
## 7. The big print gives and the small print takes away
    - Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
    - +
    - space
    - #
## 8. Sarcasm is lost in print
    - Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
    - l
    - h
    - Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X
## 9. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests
    - Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
## 10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
    - Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
## 11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
    - Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
## 12. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection
    - Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
## 13. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party
    - Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
    - r : prints the reversed string
## 14. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring
    - Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
    - R: prints the rot13'ed string
## 15.  *
    - All the above options work well together.
